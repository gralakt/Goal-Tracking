### Background
This application was my final project on the Harvard 'CS50 Web Development with Python and JavaScript' course.
I was able to get the highest possible rating for that capstone project and thanks to that
after many months of study and concentrated hard work,
I was awarded with a certificate documenting my knowledge (available on my LinkedIn profile),
with the highest marks for all of my six projects.

When creating the idea for app, I aimed to combine a Calendar and a Reminders applications from iOS.
